# TASK 3 - PASSWORD GENERATOR

This is a Python-based password generator application built using `tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to generate secure passwords with customizable options for length, character types (uppercase letters, numbers, symbols), and displays the password strength. The application also includes a password history feature for storing recent passwords and provides an option to copy passwords to the clipboard.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Users can generate passwords with custom length (between 4 and 64 characters) and select options to include:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special symbols (punctuation)
  
- **Password Strength Indicator**: The app evaluates password strength and displays it in real-time (Weak, Medium, or Strong).
  
- **Password History**: The last 5 generated passwords are stored and displayed. Users can click on any password in the history to copy it to the clipboard.

- **Clipboard Copy**: Easily copy the generated password to the clipboard with one click.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (usually included by default in Python installations)

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
